# Two spam/non-spam datasets trained on the same machine learning model

This project consists of the same autoencoder-based model used for binary classification on two different dataset (both written in Python).

## The models are split into two different folders

The first model is in folder ML_model1 and ML_model2, and each contains their respective dataset, results, and program files.

### Dependencies

- Scikit Learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras
