# Two spam/non-spam datasets trained on the same machine learning model

This project consists of the same autoencoder-based model used for binary classification on two different dataset (both written in Python).

## The models are split into two different folders

The first model is in folder ML_model1 and ML_model2, and each contains their respective dataset, results, and program files.
There are also visual images that have been generated to better visualize results that can be found in the results folder.
